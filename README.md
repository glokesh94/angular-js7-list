# Angular
Welcome to Angular! Angular helps you build modern applications for the web, mobile, or desktop.  This guide shows you how to build and run a simple Angular app. You'll use the Angular CLI tool to accelerate development, while adhering to the Style Guide recommendations that benefit every Angular project.  This guide takes less than 30 minutes to complete. At the end of this guide—as part of final code review—there is a link to download a copy of the final application code. (If you don't execute the commands in this guide, you can still download the final application code.)
